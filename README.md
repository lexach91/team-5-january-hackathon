# Deployment
## Version Control

## GitHub Pages / Heruku etc.

As a deployment solution to our project we chose to use 'GitHub Pages'. This is a resource developers can use to test how their websites look on a cloud platform.

Here are the steps we took to deploy our website.

1. In the repository we selected 'settings'.
2. Within the options on the left middle of the screen we navigated to the 'pages' section.
3. We then selected a branch to test.
4. Once this was completed we recieved a URL for the website.
