# Deployment

## Version Control

We used GitPod and Visual Studio Code as a local repository and IDE & GitHub as a remote repository.

Process for GitPod:

1. The repository was created on GitHub and we gave it the named team-5-january-hackathon.
2. We then opened that repository on GitPod by prefixing 'gitpod.io/' to the URL at the top of the page within this repository.
3. GitPod opened new workspaces for us to use.
4. Opened a new terminal.

Process for Visual Studio Code:

1. We opened VS code on our local machines.
2. Made sure we had git installed.
3. Opened a new terminal.

Together using our terminals:

1. We each created a new branch for each of us to use by typing: git name-of-branch
2. We navigated to our branches by typing: git switch name-of-branch


Once we were in our branches we used:

1. **git pull origin main** This pulls all data from the main branch.
2. **git add name-of-file** This adds a file to be committed.
3. **git commit -m "Commit message"** This allows us to attach a message to our committed code.
4. **git push origin name-of-branch** This final command pushes our work to a branch of our choosing.

## GitHub Pages

As a deployment solution to our project we chose to use 'GitHub Pages'. This is a resource a developer can use to test how their websites look on a cloud platform.

Here are the steps we took to deploy our website.

1. In the repository we selected 'settings'.
2. Within the options on the left middle of the screen we navigated to the 'pages' section.
3. We then selected a branch to test.
4. Once this was completed we received a URL for the website.

## How to clone this Repository

Below is a list of steps to help you clone this repository:

1. Please log in to your GitHub account to get started.
2. Then create a new repository within your account and give it a name.
3. In this repository at the top of the page click the green button labelled 'code'.
4. Choose the HTTPS option and copy the URL link you see to your clipboard.
5. You will need to open your 'IDE' and have 'git' installed.
6. Once you have git installed open a terminal.
7. Type: git clone URL-from-this-repository

Once steps 1 - 7 are completed you will now have a clone of this repository on your local machine to use.
